Resets all build parameters to their default values except if the build has been triggered manually by the user.<br/><br/>

Parameterized builds in Jenkins reuse the parameter values known before the execution of the Pipeline script.
However, this may cause unexpected behavior, e.g. if the <code>parameters</code> directive of the <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#parameters">Pipeline Syntax</a> is used.
In such a situation the default parameter values are usually taken from the last build as some updated values are not yet known to the executor.
However, this is not desired for automated builds. Automated builds shall always use the latest default values for their build parameters.
